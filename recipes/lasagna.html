    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna with Meat Sauce is a delightful Italian recipe that can be prepared for treating someone special. Loaded
        with cheese, this lasagna recipe might seem difficult at first with expert cooking skills. However, much to your
        surprise, the more hard work you will use for making this amazing dish, the more fruitful it will be. This
        lasagna recipe uses <strong>five</strong> types of cheese and <strong>two</strong> types of meat. But, you can
        replace the pork meat if you do not have it as the dish will turn out well even without it. If you have to serve
        this dish in a party, make the preparations well in advance as it is an elaborate dish and might take some time
        to cook. Handle the final dish <em>very gently</em> or it might disintegrate or crumble. If you do not have all
        the varieties of cheese mentioned in the recipe, you can also prepare it with the commonly available ones. The
        types of cheese simply add to the flavours. It can be served as a main dish and also be served in small portions
        as a starter recipe. If you want to surprise your guests with some innovative dish, try out this easy recipe!
